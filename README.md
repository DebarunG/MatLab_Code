# MatLab_Code
Hello! This is where you will find the MatLab codes that I have used for my own projects in the past. For now, this only includes one .txt file called `Dissertation_Index`,
but I aim to add more to it as I keep learning and practicing more stuff. 

## Dissertation Index
I created this piece of code with help from my friend, Sarbojoy, who taught me the basics of MatLab so that I could run a double summation using nested loops.
The basic idea behind the code is that I am using the nested loops to create a religious polarization index for every district of every state in India (in this case, it's West
Bengal). I used the formula mentioned in [(Montalvo and Reynal-Querol, 2005)](https://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/handle/10230/1007/770.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) as shown below:
